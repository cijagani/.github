I am writing to inform you about a recent incident that has occurred on my GitHub account, and I want to sincerely apologize for any inconvenience it may have caused.

It has come to my attention that **my GitHub account was compromised, and an unauthorized individual gained access to it**. Regrettably, this resulted in the posting of random and crypto-related GitHub issues that were not created by me.

I want to assure you that I take the security of my accounts very seriously, and I have taken immediate steps to rectify the situation.

I have already changed my passwords, enabled two-factor authentication, and thoroughly reviewed the security settings on my GitHub account to prevent any future unauthorized access.

I understand the importance of maintaining a professional and secure online presence, and I am committed to addressing this issue promptly. I sincerely apologize for any confusion or concern that this incident may have caused you.

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me directly. I appreciate your understanding and patience as I work to resolve this matter.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely, Chirag jagani
